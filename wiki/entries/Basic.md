# Basic
(Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)

is a family of general-purpose, high-level [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) designed for ease of use.

The emergence of BASIC took place as part of a wider movement towards time-sharing systems. First conceptualized during the late 1950s, the idea became so dominant in the computer industry by the early 1960s that its proponents were speaking of a future in which users would "buy time on the computer much the same way that the average household buys power and water from utility companies"
